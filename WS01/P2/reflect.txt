In this workshop I learned how to build a C++ application using modules. In part two of this workshop I 
inluded 3 modules: the Phone module, the cStrTools module, and the directory module. The Phone and 
cStrTools module are both made up of a header file and implementation file. I learned that in the header 
files is where I should declare constant variables and function prototypes. In the implementation files is 
where I define the functions. I learned C++ concepts such as namespaces. The cstring library and the 
iostream library belong to a namespace called std. Unlike C, in C++ it is best practice to write code inside 
of namespaces (in this workshop the namespaces I made are called sdds). I learned about the concept of 
scopes. I was able to use functions and constant variables that are defined in other modules, by 
including the header files and employing the "using" keyword. I learned how to safeguard header files to 
minimize the risk that a header file will be included twice and result in bugs. I learned to print output 
and read user input, as well as read from a file multiple times. Lastly, I learned how to use the g++ 
compiler on matrix and also use valgrind to check for errors.
